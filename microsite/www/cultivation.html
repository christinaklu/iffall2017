        <p>Camellia sinensis is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates.[50] Some varieties can also tolerate marine climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in the United Kingdom,[51] Perthshire in Scotland,[52] Washington state in the United States,[53] and Vancouver Island in Canada.[54] In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart on the Australian island of Tasmania[55][56] and Waikato in New Zealand.[57]
<br />
Tea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and about three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting.[50] In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall a year and prefer acidic soils.[58] Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more slowly, they acquire a better flavour.
