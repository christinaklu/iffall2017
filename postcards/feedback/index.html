	<h1>Things to Talk About My Postcards Before Feedback</h1>
	<p> <li> How are the Images cropped, and will it work when resized up or down?</li>
		<li> Should I change the font color based on the image?</li>
		<li>Are there any other ways I can make the postcard more visually interesting besides a big image and some font?</li>
		<li> Should I change the background color?</li>
	</p>
	<h1>Jee's Postcards Critique</h1>
	<p>
	<li>Some of the images are low-res</li>
	<li>All of the images have a white background that stand out from the black background</li>
	<li>Font choice could be better related to the images</li>
	<li>The final image is visually different from the rest, maybe change it so it fits with the rest of the postcards</li>

<h1>Jia Yu's Postcards Critique</h1>
<p>
	<li>Overall, I don't really see any glaring issues</li>
	<li>One problem would be how the font jumps in placement from the desktop to mobile format, but that can be fixed easily</li>
	<li>Typeface can change so it stands out from the image more</li>
