	[Intro]</p>
<p>
[Verse 1]
<br />
When the night has come
<br />
And the land is dark
<br />
And the moon is the only light we'll see
<br />
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid
<br />
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
<br />
So darlin', DARLIN', stand by me, oh now now stand by me
<br />
Stand stand by me, stand by me
</p>
<p>
[Verse 2]
<br />
If the sky that we look upon
<br />
Should tumble and fall
<br />
And the mountains should crumble to the sea
<br />
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear
<br />
Just as long as you stand, stand by me
</p>
<p>
[Chorus]
<br />
And darlin', <em>DARLIN',</em> stand by me, oh now now
<br />
Stand by me
<br />
Stand by, stand by me, stand by me
</p>
<p>
Darlin', <em>DARLIN',</em> stand by me, stand by me
<br />
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
</p>
<p>
[Bridge]
<br />
WHENEVER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WON'T YOU STAND BY ME,
<br />
oh now now stand by me
<br />
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
</p>
<p>
Darlin', <em>DARLIN',</em> stand by me, stand by me
<br />
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
