Bad luck to talk on these rides <br />
Mine on the road<br />
Your dilated eyes watch the clouds float<br />
White Ferrari <br />
Had a good time <br />
<em>(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)</em>
<br />
I let you out at Central <br />
I didn't care to state the plain <br />
Kept my mouth closed <br />
We're both so familiar <br />
White Ferrari
</p>
<p class="two">
Stick by me <br />
Close by me <br />
You were fine <br />
You were fine here <br />
That's just a slow body <br />
You left when I forgot to speak <br />
So I text the speech, lesser speeds <br />
Texas speed, yes <br />
Basic takes its toll on me <br />
'Ventually, 'ventually, yes <br />
Ah on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes 
</p>
<p class="three">
I care for you still and I will forever <br />
That was my part of the deal, honest <br />
We got so familiar <br />
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari <br />
Good times <br />
In this life, life <br />
In this life, life
</p>
<p class="four">
<em>One too many years <br />
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift <br />
Mind over matter is magic <br />
I do magic <br />
If you think about it it'll be over in no time <br />
And that's life <br /> 
Ooh, oooh, oooh, ooh</em>
</p>
<p class="five">
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension <br />
You say we're small and not worth the mention <br />
You're tired of movin', your body's achin' <br />
We could vacay, there's places to go <br />
Clearly this isn't all that there is <br />
Can't take what's been given <br />
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine <br />
Primal and naked <br />
You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned <br />
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it <br />
<em>And we're free to roam...</em>
