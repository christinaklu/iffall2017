	When the night has come
	<br />
	And the land is dark
	<br />
	And the moon is the only light we'll see
	<br />
	No, I won't be afraid
	<br />
	Oh, I won't be afraid
	<br />
	Just as long as you stand
	<br />
	Stand by me
	<br />
	</p>

	<p>
	So darlin', <strong>darlin'</strong>
	<br />
	Stand by me, oh, stand by me
	<br />
	Oh, stand, stand by me
	<br />
	Stand by me
	<br />
	</p>

	<p>
	If the sky that we look upon
	<br />
	Should tumble and fall
	<br />
	Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
	<br />
	I won't cry, I won't cry
	<br />
	No, I won't shed a tear
	<br />
	Just as long as you stand
	<br />
	Stand by me
	<br />
	</p>

	<p>
	And darlin', <strong>darlin'</strong>
	<br />
	Stand by me, oh, stand by me
	<br />
	Oh, stand now, stand by me
	<br />
	Stand by me
	<br />
	</p>

	<p>
	Darlin', <strong>darlin'</strong>
	<br />
	Stand by me, oh, stand by me
	<br />
	Oh, stand now, stand by me
	<br />
	Stand by me
	<br />
	Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
	<br />
	Oh, stand by me
	<br />
	Won't you stand now?
	<br />
	Oh, stand, stand by me
	<br />
	<em>When all of our friends is gone</em>
	<br />
